# ðŸŸ¢Â Advertisements

ChatGPT can help us generate ad copy and promotional images, which is very helpful for marketing and brand building. Usually, a product will have a main tagline that conveys the design concept or promotes the benefits of the product. We can try to generate the copy directly and see if ChatGPT has any good ideas. Let's say our product is a hiking shoe. How can we get satisfactory ad copy and promotional images?

## Background Research

ChatGPT can help you quickly familiarize yourself with the background of a field. We will further introduce how to turn ChatGPT into a learning assistant in later chapters.

<AIInput>

Some of these points are things that I, as a layman, have learned for the first time. So let's move on and ask ChatGPT to generate a complete ad plan for us.

## Ad Plan

ChatGPT generated a very complete promotional campaign. We can follow its output of points 2 and 3 to further develop our titles and copy based on the characteristics of **lightweight, non-slip, and breathable**. We can also use elements such as **appearance, material, and details** to create images that attract people to buy.

<AIInput>
ðŸ’¡ My product is a hiking shoe. Give me a complete ad plan. Please output it in list form.
</AIInput>

1. **Target Audience:** People who love outdoor activities and hiking.
2. **Ad Platforms:** Social media platforms, search engine ads.
3. **Ad Copy:** Be concise, highlighting the unique selling points and advantages of the product, such as lightweight, non-slip, breathable, and guide users to take action, such as purchasing or learning more.

## Promotional Images

Let's create a promotional image:

<AIInput>
ðŸ’¡ I need a promotional image for hiking shoes.

The purpose of this image is to serve as an ad for my hiking shoes.

Highlight the durability, waterproofing, and comfort of the hiking shoes in the image. I want the image to be in a hiking scenario.

Can you describe this ad image in detail for me?
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
Sure, I can help you describe this promotional image for your hiking shoes. This image should attract the attention of hiking enthusiasts and highlight the durability, waterproofing, and comfort of the shoes.

First, the scene should be set on a hiking trail or at the foot of a mountain. Choose a challenging trail to showcase the performance of the hiking shoes. It is recommended to choose bright weather to highlight the colors and details of the hiking shoes.

In the image, there should be a hiker wearing these hiking shoes. This person should be wearing full hiking gear, such as hiking poles, a headlamp, a hiking hat, etc., to highlight the professionalism of the hiker.

The hiking shoes should be the main focus of the image. Use a close-up to highlight the details of the hiking shoes. The texture and fabric details on the shoe surface should be clearly visible. At the same time, showcase the functionality of the hiking shoes, such as the slip-resistant sole and waterproof material.

Finally, consider adding some text to describe the features of the hiking shoes, such as "Durable, Waterproof, Comfortable." Place the text in the corner or edge of the image to provide consumers with product information.

In summary, the promotional image for the hiking shoes should be high-definition, realistic, and natural, highlighting the features of the hiking shoes, attracting the attention of hikers, and promoting product sales.

</AIOutput>

> Here, I used an instant image generation site [Stable Diffusion Online](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo). You can copy the descriptive text generated in this step to the Stable Diffusion Playground and generate it with one click.

<AIInput>
ðŸ’¡ Describe this image in English.
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>

A hiker wearing the shoes should be featured on a challenging trail or at the foot of a mountain, showcasing the shoe's performance. The image should also emphasize the details and functionality of the hiking shoe, such as the slip-resistant sole and waterproof material. Additionally, some text can be added to the corner or edge of the image to describe the product's features.
