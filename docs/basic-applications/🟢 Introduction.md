# ðŸŸ¢ Introduction

Congratulations! You have now learned how to write prompts. This section focuses on how to use prompts to solve tasks encountered in daily life or work. If you already have a set of prompts, how do you decide which prompts are suitable for the task at hand? In this section, we will provide you with inspiration through some practical examples. When selecting cases, we aim to show how to break down complex work tasks into interrelated smaller tasks. For example, in PPT creation, we can follow these steps:

1. Generate ideas
2. Refine ideas and background, generating a specific number of PPT slides
3. Use role-playing to ask ChatGPT to simplify the content of the first slide
4. Extract the remaining PPT slides following the simplified style of the first slide
5. The content slides can be re-adjusted according to different ordering methods such as examples or timelines
6. Generate a cover page and background images based on the previous content

By breaking down the major task of creating a PPT, steps 1-6 respectively become tasks of text generation, text summarization, structured data generation, text simplification, and so on. These tasks often have publicly available instruction sets, or we can quickly complete the prompt writing using the ideas from the previous chapter.
