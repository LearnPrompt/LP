You may feel that the content is less substantial than the articles we usually read, and the generated content is not fully in accordance with the outline. This is because the length of the content generated by ChatGPT is limited. If you want to generate long articles that match your impression, I suggest you expand the content on the current basis.

## Content extension

<AIInput>
ðŸ’¡ Please explain the content of the first paragraph "News Media Industry" in detail. The number of words is limited to 500 words. The content must be true and reliable. It can be divided into small paragraphs. Each small paragraph should have a sentence that summarizes the paragraph.
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
ChatGPT technology is more and more widely used in the field of news media. The digitalization of the news industry has promoted the development of automated content generation technology. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, ChatGPT, as one of the natural language generation models, has great potential to generate high-quality news articles.

First of all, ChatGPT can generate high-quality news summaries. The news summary is the core summary and refinement of an article, which usually contains the main idea and important information of the article. Traditional news summary generation requires manual editing and writing, but ChatGPT can automatically generate high-quality news digests, thus reducing the workload of editing. By training the ChatGPT model, it can learn a large number of historical news articles and automatically extract key information and generalizations of articles according to user needs, thus generating high-quality news digests. This not only improves work efficiency, but also ensures the quality of the article.

Secondly, ChatGPT can also be used to automate the generation of news reports. News reporting is one of the core businesses of the news industry, which usually requires a lot of time and labor costs. However, ChatGPT can generate high-quality news articles by learning a large number of historical news reports. It can automatically extract key information and events from historical reports and generate new reports according to user needs. In this way, ChatGPT can not only save time and cost, but also improve the accuracy and timeliness of news reports.

Third, ChatGPT can also be used for news translation and multilingual reporting. With the continuous progress of globalization, the news media industry needs to process and translate news reports from different languages and cultural backgrounds. Traditional translation and conversion processes usually require a lot of time and labor costs. However, ChatGPT can automatically translate and translate, thus improving work efficiency. It can learn news reports in multiple languages and cultural contexts and generate high-quality translation and translation results, so as to meet the needs of different languages and cultural contexts.
</AIOutput>

## Style adjustment

Through content expansion, ChatGPT generates content about its impact on the news media industry. However, in the process of reading, you will find that the general content generated by ChatGPT is a little boring. At this time, we can stylize the content itself, let ChatGPT complete the writing in a dialogue way, or let him imitate the professor and write through the style of the teaching plan. You can even show ChatGPT the blog content you have written before and let it imitate your writing style.

<AIInput>
ðŸ’¡ Please rewrite the above in an informal and conversational way.
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>

Adapting the style in the form of dialogue may not be a good idea; for me, it reads more like a speech.

Then let's try to let ChatGPT imitate your style and write a paragraph:

<AIInput>

ðŸ’¡ Is there anything I can do for you?

Example 1: What impact will ChatGPT have on the media industry?

On the one hand, ChatGPT is changing the way human-computer interaction and information acquisition. Nowadays, people are very familiar with touch screen, voice, somatosensory interaction and other computer interaction methods, and ChatGPT has advanced the interaction between people and machines. ChatGPT has stronger self-learning ability and can generate its own content based on big data. The answers given are no longer mechanical scripts that lack information. The logic and integrity have been greatly improved, and it is more humane. Its performance in news background mining, literature review and analysis are worth looking forward to.

On the other hand, ChatGPT will help the media industry create new types of content and services. In addition to helping content production, ChatGPT can also create language model-driven chat robots, change traditional media business models, and develop new content products and interactive experiences. The Xinhua News Agency client has tested the news intelligent voice robot "Xiaoxin" in response to user instructions such as "What's the major news at the National Two Sessions", "What's the weather like tomorrow" and "I want to book a ticket to Shanghai". CCTV's "Voice of China" and CCTV Media have also jointly launched the "The Following" App, hoping to create "Chat News" to give users a high-quality instant news interactive experience. With the maturity of intelligent chat programs, chat news products have huge room for development.
