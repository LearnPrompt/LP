# ðŸŸ¢ V5 Prompt Template

Creating prompts from scratch is an exciting process, but it can quickly become exhaustingâ€”especially since longer prompts perform significantly better in Midjourney V5.

Here, I provide a general template that you can use to guide all your prompts:

| Subject | Background, Environment, Atmosphere | Style | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a botanical-bearded fairy prince, flowing hair, sky-eyes, symmetrical mossy antlers, intensely sad gaze, wearing a floral diadem, | magical details, twilight atmosphere, | in the style of ArtGerm, Alyssa Monks, Studio Ghibli, close-up, glamour shot | --v5 --aspect 9:16 |

The reason for this setup is:

- Prompt order matters
- Style is more important in V5 than in any previous model.

If no style is specified, we get photorealism, which is the default style of Midjourney V5.

If you want to deviate from this style, we can refer to artistic movements, techniques, genres, media types, game names, directors, artists' names, time periods, and more.

> ðŸ’¡ An artistic movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, ranging from a few months to decades.

- Artistic Movements: Include **Impressionism**, **Surrealism**, or **Pop Art**.
- Media Types: Include **photography, illustration, comic, concept art, storyboard, sculpture**, etc.
- Media: We can evoke familiar media to influence the final result, such as **from Spirited Away** or **from The Wizard of Oz** or **from Sid Meier's Civilization** or **from the video game Joust**.
- Artists' Names: Referencing specific artists' names or works will roughly evoke their unique styles. Examples include **Vincent van Gogh**, **Frida Kahlo**, or **Banksy**.
- Mediums: Switching to different artistic mediums can add that style to the image. Examples include **impasto, pencil sketch, watercolor** or **digital art**.
- Time: For example, images from the **Renaissance**, **Baroque**, or **Modernist** periods.
- Geographic Location: Regions and countries also influence styles. Examples include **Japanese Ukiyo-e prints**, **African tribal art**, or **American Abstract Expressionism**.
