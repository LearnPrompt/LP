# ðŸŸ¢ Multi-Prompt Techniques

Use double colons "::" in prompts to indicate that Midjourney Bot should consider each part of the prompt separately.

In the example below, the prompt **hot dog** is considered as a single concept, and Midjourney Bot generates an image of a hotdog. If the prompt is split into two parts **hot:: dog**, Midjourney Bot considers the two concepts separately, resulting in an image of a "hot" dog.

## Multi-Prompt Weights

When using double colons :: to split prompts into different parts, you can immediately follow the double colons with a number to assign the relative importance of that part of the prompt.

In the example below, the prompt **hot:: dog** generates a warm dog.

Changing the prompt to **hot::2 dog** makes the term "hot" twice as important as the term "dog", resulting in a fiery dog!
