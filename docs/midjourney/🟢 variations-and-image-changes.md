# üü¢ Variations and Image Changes

> ü§† Use the `V1` `V2` `V3` `V4` buttons below each image grid to create subtle or strong variations of the generated images, or use the `Vary (Subtle)` button.

Use the **`üé® High Variation Mode`** and **`üé® Low Variation Mode`** settings to control the amount of variation created with these buttons. You can also use the **`ü™Ñ Vary (Strong)`** or **`ü™Ñ Vary (Subtle)`** buttons displayed below the enlarged images to create variants of the enlarged images. **`ü™Ñ Vary (Region)`** modifies selected areas in the generated image without changing the entire image.

## **Comparison of Variations**

- For **`üé® High Variation Mode`** and **`ü™Ñ Vary (Strong)`**, using the "Vary" button will generate new images that may change the composition, number of elements, colors, and types of details in the image. **`High Variation Mode`** is useful for creating multiple concepts based on a single generated image.
- **`üé® Low Variation Mode`** and **`ü™Ñ Vary (Subtle)`** generate variants that retain the main composition of the original image but make subtle changes to its details. This mode is helpful for refining or making slight adjustments to an image.

## **How to Control the Amount of Variation**

### **Using the Variation Buttons**

Use the **`ü™Ñ Vary (Strong)`** or **`ü™Ñ Vary (Subtle)`** buttons below the enlarged images to create strong or subtle variations of that image.

### **Using the Settings Command**

Use the **`/settings`** command and select **`üé® High Variation Mode`** or **`üé® Low Variation Mode`** from the menu to set your preference for more or less variation when using the **`V1`** **`V2`** **`V3`** **`V4`** buttons.

### **Using the /prefer Variability Command**

Toggle between **`üé® High Variation Mode`** and **`üé® Low Variation Mode`** when using the **`V1`** **`V2`** **`V3`** **`V4`** buttons under the image grid.

## Regional Variations

> Use the Midjourney Vary Region Editor to select and regenerate specific parts of an enlarged image.

### **4. Choose the Area to Regenerate**

- Select the freehand or rectangular selection tool in the lower left corner of the editor.
- Choose the area of the image to regenerate.
    - The size you choose will affect your results. Larger selections give Midjourney more room to generate new creative details. Smaller selections result in smaller, more subtle changes.

### **5. Submit Your Work**

Click the **`Submit ‚Üí`** button to send your request to the Midjourney Bot. You can now close the Vary Region editor and return to Discord while the job is processing.

Note: You can use the **`üñåÔ∏è Vary (Region)`** button below the enlarged image multiple times to try different selections. Your previous selections will be retained. You can continue to add to this existing selection or use the **`undo`** button to clear your selections.
