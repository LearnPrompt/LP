**U.S. Copyright Office Stance on Registration of AI-Generated Content**

The U.S. Copyright Office took a decisive stance, [denying copyright](https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-february-2023) registration for images created by the AI algorithm Midjourney. The rejection set a precedent, asserting that AI artworks solely created by AI, without human involvement, are ineligible for copyright protection. In the same vein, the [U.S. Copyright Office issued guidance](https://journal.everypixel.com/top-ai-news-march-2023) on AI-assisted works, clarifying that works created by humans using AI tools may be eligible for copyright protection. The guidance confirmed that works created by humans using AI tools should be evaluated based on whether the human role in the creation of those works was determinative.

> _“Currently, the existing legal system is not prepared to acknowledge copyright for works created with AI, given that AI learns from existing data, the rights to which belong to other people, challenging the attribution of ownership. The practice for addressing this issue is expected to develop next year, facilitated by public participation through [state-conducted surveys](https://www.copyright.gov/policy/artificial-intelligence/ "state-conducted surveys"). Resolving this matter independently is now difficult without broader public engagement.”_
