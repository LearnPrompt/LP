# 🟢 ChatGPT Registration & Recharge

## ChatGPT Registration/Login 

Prerequisites

- Clean, accessible network to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - check IP purity at: [https://scamalytics.com/ip](https://scamalytics.com/ip)
- Foreign phone number

### Virtual Numbers (Optional) 

- Virtual SMS website [https://sms-activate.org](https://sms-activate.org/)

> The country of the phone number does not need to match the region of the card or gift card used for GPT-4 recharge. India or Indonesia is recommended.
> 

The whole process is straightforward:

1. Select service and country
2. Purchase number and copy it
3. Enter it in the appropriate field
4. The SMS code will appear on the website

After registration, proceed to recharge. Choose a VISA card or Alipay for recharging; the virtual number cost is about 1.3 RMB per time, and the default recharge currency is USD. You can opt to recharge the minimum of one dollar.

Search for OpenAI and click. Once the number is successfully rented, it will show as waiting for SMS ⌛️. Just enter the applied phone number in the phone number field during the OpenAI registration process and wait for the verification code.

### Registering an Account

- Click to open the OpenAI registration page to register, supporting Google account, Microsoft account, and Apple account
- After successful registration, it will jump to the phone number filling page
- Enjoy! You can now start using ChatGPT～

## GPT-4 Recharge Method 1 

- Virtual credit card, recommended [WildCard](https://bewildcard.com/i/AIWARTS)
- [Foreign address generator](https://www.meiguodizhi.com/usa-address/oregon)

After activating the credit card, log in to your ChatGPT account, click Upgrade to Plus, then click Upgrade plan

Then fill in the card information and billing information (refer to the credit card activation information)

It is best to reuse the address used when activating the card for the billing address

After filling in the information, click subscribe/Subscribe and wait for verification to successfully subscribe to ChatGPT Plus.

## GPT-4 Recharge Method 2

- US AppleID
- Purchase a gift card

> 
- Step 1: Open Alipay and switch the region to San Francisco, an international hotspot
- Step 2: After modification, return to the Alipay homepage and click "Huichujing" in the middle of the bottom
- Step 3: Click "Discount Gift Cards" in the new interface
- Step 4: Scroll to the bottom and click "More Brands"
- Step 5: Click to search for iTunes to view

After purchasing the gift card, the US ID account can directly subscribe to ChatGPT plus, which is GPT-4

> If you encounter the issue of "Your Purchase Could Not Be Completed" when subscribing to ChatGPT Plus with a gift card, don't panic. Download Apple support and contact customer service to solve it. Before contacting, make sure to disguise your phone's region, language, and IP as the US and ensure your account has no abusive behavior. (There is a chance of account ban by customer service)
