# Basic Skills: Prompt

The core skill of ChatGPT is learning how to set Prompts. You can understand Prompt as a "hint," which aims to make ChatGPT enter a certain conversation mode.

In ChatGPT, a prompt usually refers to a paragraph or phrase of input text, serving as the starting point or guide for generating model output. A prompt can be a question, a text description, a conversation segment, or any form of text input. The model generates corresponding output text based on the context and semantic information provided by the prompt, and the quality of the output is greatly influenced by the prompt.

## **What can we do with ChatGPT now?**

ChatGPT is reshaping our workflow, automating tasks that used to consume a lot of your time. Tasks like writing emails, generating reports, and even coding can be performed or provided a foundation by simply describing them to artificial intelligence. This potential is immense, and AI will become a powerful assistant to optimize your productivity.

Here are some areas ChatGPT currently covers:

1. Text Generation and Understanding: ChatGPT can generate coherent and logical text and understand natural language input.
2. Multilingual Support: Supports multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, etc.
3. Knowledge Query: Can query concepts and explain them in an easy-to-understand form.
4. Text Transformation and Translation: Can perform text summarization, translation, etc.
5. Creative Writing: Can assist in creative writing such as novels and poetry.
6. Programming and Math Assistance: Can explain programming concepts and assist in solving math problems, etc.

GPT-4 is currently OpenAI's most advanced system. Unlike the plain text input of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, the new features of GPT-4 include:

1. Ultra-long text input, up to 25,000 words
2. Converting hand-drawn website prototypes into actual websites using HTML and JavaScript technologies
3. Allowing users to upload images for analysis and description
4. Handling more complex instructions than GPT-3.5
5. Writing entire video games in the browser
6. Providing an API for developers to build applications and services
7. Using plugins: such as WebPilot, for accessing web content, etc.

### **Powerful Plugin System**

Plugins provide GPT-4 with a broader set of functions, allowing it not only to generate and understand text but also to perform specific tasks such as mathematical calculations, image generation, music playback, etc.

1. Prompt Perfect: Helps users write perfect prompts so that AI chatbots can provide more specific and information-rich answers.
2. Wolfram: Provides advanced computation, mathematics, and real-time data solutions.
3. Zapier: Interacts with over 5000 different work applications, streamlining workflows.
4. Argil AI: Allows users to generate images within ChatGPT.
5. Link Reader: Reads the content of various links, including web pages, PDFs, images, etc.
6. Speak: A language coach plugin that can teach you how to say anything in other languages.
7. MixerBox OnePlayer: A music compiler that can collect songs and create playlists upon request.
8. Show Me: Allows ChatGPT to create almost any type of real-time charts.
9. Questmate Forms: Quickly and easily create various forms.
10. Image Editor: Provides basic image editing functions such as resizing, cropping, blurring, etc.
11. World News: Provides the latest global news.
12. Chess: Allows users to play chess with ChatGPT.
13. Meme Generator: Generates memes on various themes.
14. A+ Doc Maker: Allows you to create beautiful PDFs in seconds.
15. CoderPad: Allows you to run code in more than 30 programming languages within ChatGPT.

### Analysis Also Known as **Code Interpreter**

> Updated on 2023.115: The new version of GPT-4 has integrated Analysis, Browsing, and DALLE3 into the All Tools capability.
> 

The Code Interpreter is a notable new feature in GPT-4, combining the powerful analytical capabilities of large language models with the practicality of programming. By allowing the execution of Python code and file uploads, the code interpreter significantly expands the range of tasks ChatGPT can perform, from data analysis to image conversion, to editing code files.

- **Richer Interactive Experience**: You can upload files to supplement verbal instructions, providing ChatGPT with richer context. This reduces the ambiguity of explanations and lowers the possibility of errors compared to plain text input.
- **Intuitiveness Similar to Video Calls**: Imagine when you encounter a technical problem, instead of monotonously describing and understanding text instructions, you can intuitively share your screen and demonstrate the problem. Such rich understanding enables technical support to provide more precise solutions.
- **Intuitive Output Feedback**: Unlike the default GPT-4 which only provides text, the code interpreter actually runs the code and provides ready-made output. You can not only see the results but also understand how they are derived, and even run the code yourself.
- **Support for Diverse File Formats**: From text, images, documents to code, data, audio, and video, the code interpreter supports various common file formats, including but not limited to:

1. Text (.txt, .csv, .json, .xml, etc.)
2. Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)
3. Documents (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.)
4. Code (.py, .js, .html, .css, etc.)
5. Data (.csv, .xlsx, .tsv, .json, etc.)
6. Audio (.mp3, .wav, etc.)
7. Video (.mp4, .avi, .mov, etc.)

The code interpreter not only elevates ChatGPT's functionality to new heights but also provides users with unprecedented flexibility and convenience, making artificial intelligence a true partner in solving complex tasks and problems.
