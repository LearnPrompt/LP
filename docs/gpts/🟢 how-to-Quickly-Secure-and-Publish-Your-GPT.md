# üü¢¬†GPT Store Launching This Week: How to Quickly Secure & Publish Your GPT

On the early morning of the 5th, Beijing time, OpenAI brought us the first surprise of the new year: "The GPT store will be launched next week." In the email, they emphasized three conditions for joining the GPT store. The first one is about the usage policy and GPT brand guidelines. Judging from the update time (March 2023) and content of these two documents, normal use will not be an obstacle. The second and third conditions (verification profile and publishing GPTs) point to a must-have condition‚Äîowning your own independent domain as soon as possible.

> Owning your own independent domain means you have a unique web address. A domain is an identifier on the internet that helps users find a specific website. For example, "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)" is a domain name.

As early as November, in our tutorial "How to Make Money with GPTs," we dissected the three main elements of GPTs: **prompts, knowledge base, and third-party web services (Action). In "VoxScript Action Version GPTs = Unlimited URLs Can Be Included in GPTs!" we explained how to customize multiple URLs as Actions, allowing GPTs to use specialized search engines. In December, we updated "Beware of Your GPTs Defense Strategies," teaching everyone how to protect their prompt wealth before GPTs commercialization.**

Yesterday, several group friends approached me, hoping to **quickly have their own domain and publish their GPTs**. Now, let me quickly walk you through this process. Moreover, at the end of the article, I will share some golden tips on how to choose the right category for your first GPT and pick a name that is easy to optimize for search engines (the higher the ranking, the easier it is to attract people to your GPTs). Don‚Äôt miss out, seize the opportunity, and become the pioneer to publish your own GPTs!

## Domain Purchase

Common platforms for purchasing domains include:

- [Alibaba Cloud](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/?utm_content=se_882117&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtOmsBhCnARIsAGPa5yZATK2zuYaZGqgkDx9JDAGNup4upM_LvqYsMVMvtP8v84J3_9Llvw0aAnZhEALw_wcB)

**Step 2: Choose a suitable suffix**

- Prefer .com / .cn domains, followed by .net and .org

## How to Position Your GPTs

Congratulations! You have mastered all the core skills to publish your personal GPTs. Now, let‚Äôs explore an important question: "**What should your first GPT focus on?**" The answer is simple: look at the data!

The charm of data lies in its ability to truly reflect public interest. Here I have created a **GPTs Top100 Traffic Analysis** chart, showing the proportion of different categories in the Top 100 GPTs in December and the traffic of different categories. You can save it as a reference for your **positioning and optimizing GPTs**.

### Tip 1: GPTs Search Optimization

In the current GPTs market, the homogenization phenomenon of user interfaces (UI) is obvious. This consistency simplifies the learning process for users but also increases the difficulty of attracting users to visit.

![UI Homogenization](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/cca03736e2b63c251c99099ef9e76ca2.png)

In such a context, the naming and introduction of GPTs have become **key differentiating factors**.

Naming strategies can be a combination of "popular keywords + specialty keywords." The effectiveness of this formula lies in: popular keywords ensure that your GPTs appear in users‚Äô search results, while specialty keywords make your content more noticeable.

Names like **New + GPT-5**, **AI + PDF**, **AI + Voice Generator** can all be broken down by the formula below.

### Tip 2: Use Domain Names to Enhance Your GPTs Ranking

In the author column of GPTs, you can choose to display your independent domain to improve the visibility of your product. A professional and unique domain can enhance the image of your work and attract more visitors.

Here are six domain naming strategies I have organized for everyone:

1. Keywords: Choose keywords related to your business as part of the domain name.
2. Concise and memorable: Choose a simple and easy-to-remember domain name.
3. Avoid numbers and hyphens: Use purely textual domain names.
4. Brand recognition: Incorporate the brand name into the domain name as much as possible.
5. Research competitors: Analyze well-performing websites in the industry to understand their domain naming strategies.
6. Use keyword tools: Use tools like Google Keyword Planner to find high search volume keywords related to your business.

In addition to compiling the GPTs data, I also made an interesting chart showing the favorite domain suffixes of the Top 100 GPTs! Besides **.com** being the perennial first choice, **.co** surprisingly ranks second.

## Conclusion

The GPT store came faster than I imagined. When we seemed to have not yet reached the limits of GPTs capabilities, it had already arrived. Now, I can't wait to see the blooming of various GPTs in the GPT store! One of the greatest charms of GPTs is that it provides a platform for more people to express themselves. Everyone can use GPT to make their "voice" heard and achieve creative freedom through "no-code" methods. We are entering an era where everyone can create and own their own products.
