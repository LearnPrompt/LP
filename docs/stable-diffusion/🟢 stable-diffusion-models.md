# ðŸŸ¢ Introduction to Stable Diffusion Models

The model is the most crucial factor determining the quality of the generated images. Thus, learning how to utilize various models to enhance the quality and style of generated images is a valuable pursuit.

You can find various models here:

## Large Models

Also known as the base model, this category includes models with the largest training datasets, which significantly impact the quality of image generation. The default large model for Stable Diffusion is typically SD x.x (version number).

The downloaded large model can be placed in the application's `models/Stable_diffusion` path for use.

## Lora Model

The Lora model is a smaller model generated from parts of the large model. It doesn't have the full capabilities of the large models but performs better under specific conditions after targeted training.

For example, if we see some Lora model images we like on C station, we can download its Lora model by clicking on the exclamation mark to view its parameters.

Once downloaded, we place the Lora model in this path

In the application, select the Lora model under additional network to use.
