# ðŸŸ¢ Introduction

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning-based text-to-image generation model, essentially a variant of diffusion models. It generates new images using prompts to describe elements to include or omit and to redraw existing images with new elements described in the prompts.

Its main functionalities include text-to-image and image-to-image generation. In text-to-image, it generates images based on input prompts, image dimensions, seeds, and other parameters. In image-to-image, it generates new images based on prompts and existing images, creating a new image on the foundation of the original one.

In the next chapter, I will explain how to install, deploy, and use Stable Diffusion. If you have more examples of Stable Diffusion, you are very welcome to join us and help us optimize this course together.
