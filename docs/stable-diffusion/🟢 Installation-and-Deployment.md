# ðŸŸ¢ Installation and Deployment

Local installation of Stable Diffusion is recommended for computers with a GPU, at least 16GB of RAM, and 8GB of VRAM. For Mac users, configurations of 8GB M1 and above are suitable for local deployment. If your computer does not meet these specifications, you can use a cloud server. Our tutorial will provide an example of deployment using Google Colab.

## Colab Installation and Deployment

## Local Deployment on Windows

For local deployment, it is recommended to have a computer with a GPU. Due to network issues in China, deploying code directly may present many challenges. Therefore, it is advised to use an integrated package for local deployment. Download the package from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/19pYemrQ3tLzq6pPg-2zWwg?pwd=jxau) using the extraction code: jxau.

First, run the application to install dependencies.
