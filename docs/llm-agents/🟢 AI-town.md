# 🟢 AI Virtual Town

AI-town is possibly one of the most inspiring AI agent experiments of 2023. We often discuss the emergent abilities of individual LLMs, but the emergence of Agents on a large scale can be more complex and fascinating. A population of AIs can demonstrate the evolution of an entire civilization.

Imagine a world where Agents live and interact in a virtual environment, learning and evolving like humans. An experiment by Stanford University and Google created 25 unique digital characters using ChatGPT. These Agents have distinct artistic appearances, personalities, dreams, and hopes.

Twenty-five AI Agents live in a digital Western world, unaware that they are in a simulated environment. They go to work, chat, organize social events, make new friends, and even fall in love. Each agent has a unique personality and backstory. During the experiment, one of the Agents organized a Valentine's Day party. They communicated, created new memories, and most of them learned about the party and attended it.

> In this digital world, we can witness the lives of the Agent, share their joys and confusions, and even see their gatherings and celebrations.

Based on the Stanford Smallville project, a team has built a real "Westworld" AI Town that we can now directly play.

## a16z AI-town

The well-known venture capital firm a16z also released an open-source project, AI-town, allowing developers to use Javascript to run and build their custom AI world SIM.

## AgentSims

A team from Beihang University, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhejiang University, and East China Normal University has developed a domestic AI town where you can create unlimited AI Agents.

After creating an AI Agent, you can set tasks or plans for them, and they can shop, work, or even argue in the virtual town. **Interestingly, there is also a mayor role that can interfere with task execution.** AgentSims aims to evaluate the performance of large models.

> When evaluating the performance of Agents, datasets play a crucial role. In the next section, we will introduce some datasets that can be used to evaluate Agents. Stay tuned to 「卡尔的AI沃茨」🧙
