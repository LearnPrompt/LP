# üü¢ AutoGPT

AutoGPT is a popular open-source project created by Toran Richards. It utilizes GPT-4 as its brain and integrates with langchain to link various tools and internet resources to accomplish tasks assigned by humans. You only need to set a goal, and AutoGPT will autonomously plan and execute the tasks step by step. If it encounters any issues, it will break down the tasks and solve them incrementally.

AutoGPT hands over control of the computer, vector space cloud storage, and various tool APIs to AI. With this, it can analyze markets and propose trading strategies, customer service, marketing, finance, or other tasks requiring continuous updates.

This is why Karpathy recently said, "AutoGPT is the next frontier in prompt engineering."

AutoGPT essentially gives GPT-based models memory and agency. You can now delegate tasks to AI agents, allowing them to autonomously formulate and execute plans, browse the web, and update strategies with new data until the task is completed.

AutoGPT consists of three components:

1. Architecture: It calls GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 through API.
2. Autonomous Iteration: AutoGPT improves its output through self-evaluation, leveraging previous work and prompt history for more accurate results.
3. Memory Management: Integration with @pinecone allows AutoGPT to store long-term memory, supporting context retention and improved decision-making.

Additionally, AutoGPT has versatile functionalities such as file operations, web browsing, and data retrieval, expanding its range of applications.

## Quick Start

- AI platform Hugging Face offers a hosted version of [AutoGPT](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aliabid94/AutoGPT). You only need to provide an OpenAI API key, assign a role to the AI, and set some goals.
- For Replit users, you can fork this [repl](https://replit.com/@nathanwchan/Auto-GPT) and provide your OpenAI API key.
- [godmode](https://godmode.space/) also allows you to input an OpenAI API key and then give AutoGPT a task to complete.
- [Cognosys](https://www.cognosys.ai/): An online tool similar to AutoGPT that doesn't require binding an OpenAI API Key.

Here we use Cognosys as an example to recreate the news summarization agent application mentioned in the previous section!

Let's see how to use Cognosys to apply AgentGPT to summarize the latest news.

![Cognosys Platform](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/62b36bd633cbaa752d56531ea8ed091b.png)

1. First, visit the Cognosys website.
2. Enter the name of the agent and the goal you want to achieve, so AgentGPT understands your needs.
3. Select the mode as Browsing to give AgentGPT internet connectivity.
4. Click Submit, and AgentGPT will utilize its powerful natural language processing capabilities to search for the latest news and present relevant summaries.
5. You can read and evaluate the generated news summaries. If needed, you can modify or refine the summaries to better suit your needs.
