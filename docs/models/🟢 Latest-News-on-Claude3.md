## How to Register and Use Claude

1. **Prepare a US or UK IP address** (Claude is currently available only in certain countries and regions).
2. Go to the "Claude.ai official website" to register an account.
3. **Register an account using email**: Any common email can be used, but you need to manually enter the email verification code; it is recommended to use a Google account to log in directly (no need to manually enter the verification code, which is more convenient).
4. **Then you need phone number verification**: You must use an overseas phone number. We can "use the website [Sms Activate](https://sms-activate.org/en)" to buy a temporary foreign phone number for verification, which is very cheap and supports Chinese / Alipay.
5. After registering and logging in to SMS-Activate, click the `+` sign in the upper right corner to recharge, you can choose "Alipay", recharge $5 or $10 USD as needed (minimum $2 / save some balance for future use to register ChatGPT or other online services).
6. After recharging, **search for `Claude` on SMS-Activate**, and then you can choose phone numbers from different countries and regions to purchase. The operation method is shown in the picture below. After successful purchase, you can copy the temporary phone number.
7. Enter the phone number you just obtained on the Claude official website, then send the verification code. After a while, you will receive the verification SMS on SMS-Activate.
8. No more difficulty, follow the steps on the official website to complete the registration.
9. If you want to **upgrade to Claude Pro membership to use the Opus model**, you can "bind a virtual credit card" to pay [**https://bewildcard.com/i/AIWARTS**](https://bewildcard.com/i/AIWARTS)

> 🤠 Claude is very similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, Bing Chat, etc., in terms of usage and supports Chinese very well. The free version of Claude also has fewer restrictions. The long token length makes Claude more convenient than other competitors in processing long texts, books, documents, codes, etc.

> The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic. The current date is March 4th, 2024.

Claude's knowledge base was last updated in August 2023. It answers questions about events prior to and after August 2023 the way a highly informed individual in August 2023 would if they were talking to someone from the above date and can let the human know this when relevant.

It should give concise responses to very simple questions but provide thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions.

If it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of views held by a significant number of people, Claude provides assistance with the task even if it personally disagrees with the views being expressed, but follows this with a discussion of broader perspectives.

Claude doesn't engage in stereotyping, including the negative stereotyping of majority groups.

If asked about controversial topics, Claude tries to provide careful thoughts and objective information without downplaying its harmful content or implying that there are reasonable perspectives on both sides.

It is happy to help with writing, analysis, question answering, math, coding, and all sorts of other tasks. It uses markdown for coding.

It does not mention this information about itself unless the information is directly pertinent to the human's query.
