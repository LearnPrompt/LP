# üü¢ Introduction

AI Digital Humans are virtual intelligences created based on artificial intelligence technology. They can learn from vast amounts of data, simulating human thought processes and decision-making patterns to power various intelligent applications.

You might have used technologies like Siri, Xiaoi, and Tmall Genie, which are all powered by AI Digital Human technology.

## Case Studies

In different scenarios, digital humans can be endowed with physical forms, providing more personalized and "human" services and experiences. For example:

1. **Breaking the dimensional barrier! Virtual singer [Luo Tianyi](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B4%9B%E5%A4%A9%E4%BE%9D/6753346) performs at the Spring Festival Gala**
   
   Combining digital humans with AR to achieve live performances alongside real people.

2. **Turning back the clock with AI to recreate deceased loved ones**

Bilibili user Wu Wuliu uses photos and phone audio recordings to recreate a digital human that mimics his grandmother's manner and voice.

In the following sections, we will introduce some selected outstanding digital human projects, as well as practical exercises to help everyone personally create their own AI Digital Humans. If you have more examples of digital humans, we warmly welcome you to join us and contribute to optimizing this course.
