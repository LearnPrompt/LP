# ðŸŸ¢ Comprehensive Project Collection

The approach to building digital humans can be divided into three steps:

- **Flesh and Bones** â€” Create the digital human's appearance.
- **Senses Creation** â€” Convert text to audio; combine audio with appearance to make the digital human "speak."
- **Soul Infusion** â€” Input domain knowledge to facilitate intelligent dialogues.

Hence, we have compiled numerous outstanding projects tailored to different domains. There's definitely one suitable for you!
