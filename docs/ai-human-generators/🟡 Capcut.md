# 🟡 Capcut's Digital Human "Personalization" – Unlimited Free Private Models

>😀 Hello everyone! I'm Carl, and today I'll share about the privatization of Capcut's digital human broadcasting.
> PS: The video version is on its way, stay tuned!

The access restrictions of Heygen are strong, and fortunately, Capcut has already developed capabilities in voice cloning and public model digital humans. Combined with face fusion technology, we can easily achieve zero-cost digital human broadcasting.

## Advantages of Creating Digital Humans with Capcut

As a product of ByteDance, Capcut is widely used for short video creation and editing on the TikTok platform. Its international version, CapCut, has topped the US App Store, and its total installations across global App Stores and Google Play have exceeded 250 million, with nearly 9.5 million in the US market alone.

What's the "magic" of Capcut? Let's check out its existing AI features:

| Automatic video editing and complete short video generation | AI painting | AI-generated Capcut copy/scripts | Voice cloning | Smart subtitles | AI virtual digital human |

These six AI capabilities essentially solve our pain points in using digital humans for video creation, allowing us to complete the **script generation → voice cloning → digital human broadcasting** process without leaving Capcut. Let's walk through making a digital human broadcast video together.

Although Capcut already has many public model digital humans, private model digital humans are more popular, as seen from the booming digital human accounts on TikTok.
