# üü¢ Low-Cost Digital Human Experience: HeyGen | D-ID | Silicon Intelligence and More - 10+ Practical Tutorials

> ü§• AI-warts Digital Human Course -- **Clone Yourself** is now live (supported by HeyGen, D-ID, Silicon Intelligence, XiaoIce Digital Human, Rask, SadTalker, Video Retalking, and other popular projects):

## **Introduction**

By the end of October, AI video translation software like HeyGen and Rask became popular by making characters speak foreign languages **üî•**, such as "Guo Degang speaking English in comedy skits," "Taylor Swift speaking Chinese," and "Teacher Cai Ming speaking English." The AI-generated videos feature clear pronunciation, natural intonation, and similar vocal timbre to the actual persons, even achieving accurate lip synchronization, distinctly different from previous "dubbed" videos.

> üí° The most common question among group members is: "AI video translation" is classified as one application of digital humans. If I want to create a digital human, which platforms are convenient to experience?

This article is here to answer that question. We will recommend three digital human creation platforms, presented in web and app forms, easy for individual users to get started with.

Currently, platforms with good AI capabilities include **HeyGen**, **D-ID**, and **Silicon Intelligence**. Others like **Jianying Digital Human**, **XiaoIce Digital Human**, and **Voice-Driven Digital Human** will be introduced in our subsequent articles.

## **HeyGen -- Create Your Personal Digital Human in 5 Minutes**

### **Latest NewsüëÇ**

On November 29, 2023, HeyGen announced a new round of venture capital funding of $5.6 million led by the renowned investment firm Conviction Partners, bringing the company's valuation to $75 million.

HeyGen focuses on advertising, corporate training, explaining, and sales‚Äîsectors that require human presence in content. Catering more to ToC consumers, HeyGen offers a rich experience of digital human features.

### **Features**

1. HeyGen includes over 100 AI avatars, supports more than 40 languages, and over 300 voices. Besides digital human voice generation and video translation for lip-syncing, the video content is more template-driven.
2. Additionally, you can create personal Avatars. On December 5, 2023, HeyGen launched its latest product‚ÄîInstant Avatar 2.0. This instant virtual persona technology requires just a smartphone and 5 minutes to create a personalized digital avatar, significantly lowering the technical barrier previously associated with creating digital humans.
3. Supports rapid video script creation with GPT. Also supports creating AI Talking Photo (Avatar) via prompts and allows for outfit changes and face swapping in one click.

## **D-ID -- Interactive Digital Human**

### **Latest NewsüëÇ**

D-ID is a product of an Israeli AI startup. Previously, the company launched projects like **Deep Nostalgia** (animating faces in old photos) and **LiveStory** (adding audio to animated photos to let the people in the photos narrate their life stories), which went viral on social media platforms like Tiktok.

Like HeyGen, D-ID also focuses on AI Avatar generation for videos, offering more credits for a longer free trial compared to HeyGen.

Besides the AI digital human video generator, the company also offers AI Presenters compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint, allowing users to add digital humans to slides and create more engaging and interactive presentations.

## **Silicon Intelligence**

> Silicon Intelligence digital humans are widely used on Chinese platforms like TikTok. In my conversations with domestic digital human providers, it's also frequently mentioned üëç

### **Basic BackgroundüëÇ**

Established in 2017, headquartered in Nanjing, China. Silicon Intelligence is a Tencent-backed AIGC digital human company.

In its 6 years, the company has completed several hundred million yuan in Series C funding, with investors including Tencent, China Merchants Bank, State-owned Enterprises, Haisong Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, with the latest valuation estimated at nearly 6 billion RMB.

According to Chen Liling, a partner at Nanjing Silicon Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd., the company has created digital doubles for over 500,000 people in the first half of 2023; it has also provided digital humans for live broadcasting in over 50,000 rooms.

### **Features**

Let me gently complain about the Silicon Intelligence user interface not being very novice-friendly, but my guide can help you quickly get started.

1. Silicon Intelligence also offers "Photos That Talk," "Basic Image Cloning," and "Video Translation," notable for supporting more Chinese faces and sitting poses with green screens, unlike HeyGen and D-ID.
2. The templates are more "grounded." While I struggled to find the "knowledge payment" template to promote my website on HeyGen, it's readily available here, clearly aimed at the current marketing scene on TikTok.
3. Supports the digital human live broadcasting system, allowing you to directly integrate your cloned digital persona into live broadcasting scenarios. The integrated live broadcasting experience takes the platform's practicality to a new level.
