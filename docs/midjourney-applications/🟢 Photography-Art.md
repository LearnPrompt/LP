# ðŸŸ¢ Photography Art

In this article, I break down the workflow of portrait photographers into several parts and demonstrate how Midjourney enhances the photographer's capabilities at each stage.

## Ideas and Inspiration

Before starting a project, you can explore [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), and many other resources to understand what other artists have done before you and seek inspiration.

Nowadays, we can also ask Midjourney for creative ideas.

## Blending Ideas

With Midjourney, you can capture a photo in the style of your favorite artist to inspire your creativity.

## Previsualization

Previsualization â€” the process of gathering reference materials, assembling mood boards, sketching, and organizing or rendering the final outcomes of future photo shoots â€” is a crucial stage in every project that allows us to better envision our ideas.

### Mood Boards and Reference Images

The first thing you should do is look for reference images and create mood boards.

Typically, I search the internet to find precise images that illustrate ideas. I try to show as detailed and accurately as possible how I view the background, styling, poses, lighting, and makeup.

With just a prompt, you can previsualize shooting styles, locations, makeup concepts, and scene atmospheres on Midjourney.

```python

```

You can also outline mood board pages directly by asking Midjourney.

Mood boards, composed of images, texts, and other samples, are visual presentation or collage used to convey ideas or feelings about a specific theme. They are commonly used by graphic designers, interior designers, industrial designers, photographers, UI designers, and other creative workers to visually explain the intended style of a project. Mood boards help balance collaboration and creative freedom during the creative process.

```python
mood board location references page for rainbow themed photo shoot --ar 2:3 --stylize 50
```

## Set Design

In complex portrait photography types, you'll want to create a unique and memorable world for your models to inhabit in your frame.

```python

```

In all prompts, I added --no people person man woman boy girl model. We only need the background itself; without this trick, Midjourney will always generate humans.

## Styling and Props

Typically, you must find the required props or costumes. You might call movie or theater productions, visit costume rentals, or involve a stylist and commission professionals. In this case, Midjourney can generate excellent prop references!

```python

## Photography Techniques

### Types of Portrait Photography

We can start with the basics of portrait photography and try asking Midjourney for some different types of portraits.

### Lighting

In Midjourney, you can set the direction, quality, and color of the light. For this test, I used a standard formula in the text part of the prompt: Portrait shot with ...

For simplicity, I will only mention the type of light below each example.

### Shutter Settings

The setting of the shutter speed can also affect the final image outcome.

### Composition

In Midjourney, we can partially control the composition of the image. Although it's currently difficult for Midjourney to specify certain types of composition (asymmetrical, eccentric, golden ratioâ€”none seem to work), you can still successfully set shooting angles.

### Lenses

Besides composition, you can also use different lenses for framing:
