# üü¢¬†Logo Design

Logo design is a challenging task as logos are a condensation of a brand's significant values.

## Quick Start

Get inspiration directly using **logo design for...**.

:::takeaways
- Generating text within images in Midjourney may not yield great results, but you can edit the image and replace the text using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/zh_cn/).
- Use prompts with [designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphic_designers) and [artists](https://arthive.com/zh/artists) who excel in the style you are seeking.

## Pictorial Mark Logos

Pictorial marks, also known as brand marks, are what you might think of when you hear ‚Äúlogo‚Äù.

## Negating prompts **-no**

Midjourney's default style tends to be complex, so you need to specify what elements you do not want. **--no realistic photo details** is a very common prompt.

You can list the elements you do not want word by word.

## Minimal Line Marks

You can use the geometric shapes and lines of objects for your Logo:

### Gradient Marks

Using gradient marks can give your brand a cutting-edge feel. You can specify the colors you want in the prompt.
