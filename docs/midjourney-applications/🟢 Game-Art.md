# ðŸŸ¢ Game Art

Midjourney now enables the generation of assets that can be directly utilized in games.

## Pixel Art

### Consoles

One of the simplest ways to incorporate pixel art into your prompts is by referencing old game consoles. Try adding the following devices to the beginning of your prompts:

- NES | Nintendo Entertainment System
- SNES | Super Nintendo Entertainment System
- PlayStation
- Sega Genesis
- Sega Dreamcast

### x-bit

8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit originally referred to the processors used in these consoles but are now used to denote the art/music style of that era.

### Game Styles

Of course, you can also reference the styles of old games for outstanding effects:

#### Castlevania (1986)

The first Castlevania was released by Konami in 1986 for the NES. It became hugely popular and remains one of Nintendo's most influential and classic games. The series is known for its difficulty, innovative mechanics, and dark gothic art style. Midjourney excels in recreating the gothic visuals that made the Castlevania series so distinctive.

#### Metal Slug (1996)

The original Metal Slug was released in 1996 on the Neo Geo arcade platform. Metal Slug is famous for its chunky and extreme level of detail.

### Pixel Backgrounds

#### Owlboy (2016)

Owlboy is a love letter to pixel art.

The development of the game lasted 10 years. During this time, the Owlboy team had to redesign the game and redraw the art assets multiple times to make the game look "timeless".

Here are some prompts for creating this style in Midjourney. They are perfect for background art.
