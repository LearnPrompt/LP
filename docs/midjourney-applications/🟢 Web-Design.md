## Quick Start

Begin your design with **"web design for..."** or **"modern web design for..."** to quickly establish your focus.

```python
web design for a generic SaaS startup --ar 3:2

## Negating prompts no

Use --no to tell Midjourney what you don't want. Midjourney's default style leans towards realism and detail, which might not suit all brands. For instance, if you're a tech-focused brand, you might prefer simpler graphics and illustrations, as these have become hallmarks of modern branding.

- Midjourney's default style, featuring lots of details and shadows.

```python
web design for a flight discount service
```

## Aspect Ratios

The aspect ratio suitable for web design is --ar 3:2

A square composition looks more like an infographic.

```python
web design for a plant database, minimal vector flat --no photo detail realistic

```

As the aspect ratio increases, the content of the images changes.
