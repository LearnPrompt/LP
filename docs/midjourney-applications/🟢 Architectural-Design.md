## Basic Structures

This is a highly suitable tip structure for production buildings in V5.

Let's first review the generic template from the last chapter:

**Theme + Background, Environment, Atmosphere + Style + Parameters**

Under the architectural generation setting, we use:

**Detailed Theme Description + Surrounding Environment + Architectural Style or Era, Architects, Designers, and Photographers + Parameters**

```python

```

The order of the prompt is crucial. The closer a word is to the beginning of the prompt, the stronger its impact. Therefore, if you really want to emphasize an architect's style, you can put their name first:

**Architect Name + Detailed Theme Description + Surrounding Environment + Other Styles, Aesthetics, Designers, and Photographers + Parameters**

## Famous Architects

### Zaha Hadid

The late Zaha Hadid, the first woman to win the architectural Oscar (the Pritzker Prize), is renowned for her futuristic designs featuring curving, swooping lines.

### Kengo Kuma

Kengo Kuma, a renowned Japanese architect, has won architectural awards in Japan, Italy, Finland, and more. His works radiate Japanese style and Eastern Zen, often referred to as "negative architecture" for their integration of natural landscapes using materials like wood, clay bricks, bamboo, stone slabs, paper, or glass, combined with water, light, and air to create seemingly delicate yet durable and warm traditional structures.

```python

## Architectural Photographers

In addition to architects, photographers are also crucial. If your prompt includes a photographer, I suggest adding the -s styling parameter and setting it lower than 100 (default is 100).

### H√©l√®ne Binet

H√©l√®ne Binet is a Swiss and French architectural photographer. She is famous for capturing the essence of architectural space through light, shadows and textures.

```python
